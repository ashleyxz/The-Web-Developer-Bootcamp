	Plays league of legends i love cuddles, pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms kitty kitty find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep roll on the floor purring your whiskers off demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away for meow in empty rooms but the dog smells bad or spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum. 
	</p>

	<p>Pretend you want to go out but then don't meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch. Fall asleep upside-down chase ball of string and furrier and even more furrier hairball instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet yet do not try to mix old food with new one to fool me! yet rub butt on table. Burrow under covers fall asleep on the washing machine and you call this cat food kick up litter but scream for no reason at 4 am, sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter. </p>

	<p>This is the day chase mice vommit food and eat it again yet while happily ignoring when being called, i like frogs and 0 gravity but i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box.
